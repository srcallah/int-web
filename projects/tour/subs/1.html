        Recreation settings such as parks, playgrounds, trails, beaches and other
        public and blue spaces are public open spaces (POSs) that provide local residents with open space
        opportunities for recreation and relaxation. Access to POSs has been recognized as an important indicator
        demonstrating how urban systems are successfully operated and an essential catalyst facilitating residentsâ€™
        perceptions of well-being.
