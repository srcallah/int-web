      <p>
        The public should be afforded full and fair access to beaches, which are public trust resources, by minimizing the possibility of impediment; including development, subdivision or land use zoning change; or deterring obstacles, including gates, fences, hired security, misleading signage, rock walls, shrubbery or other blockades, being placed upon public rights of way to beach access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Means of access to the beach (“vertical” or “perpendicular access”) should be readily available and secured so as to maximize access along the coast (“horizontal” or “lateral access”) and should not be overly burdensome for the potential beachgoer to utilize.
